# Test Karaf distribution

This directory contains the recipe for a simple [Karaf](https://karaf.apache.org/) distribution, which contains all
production Java code published by the transportpce-models project.

This artifact is not installed into the Maven repository, but can be built locally and found the `target/` directory,
both as a `.zip` and a `.tar.gz` archive.
