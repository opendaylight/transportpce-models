# TAPI models

This directory contains model packaging for models coming from
the [TAPI community](https://github.com/Open-Network-Models-and-Interfaces-ONMI/TAPI), maintained by members of the
Transport-API community. These typically start with `tapi-`.

We package a single revision of these models.

The revisions of models can be bumped across major versions.

YANG files included here should always come from the above Transport-API github repository.

Model currently packaged are:

- [tapi for 2.4 revision](2.4.0)
